# Portfolio Page – Legacy

This is the currently hosted portfolio page for Ethan Flow. A new, modern version is in development, featuring a sleeker design and a more personal touch.

This project uses:

- **Vite** – for fast development and building of the application with hot module replacement and optimized production bundling.
- **Three.js** and **@react-three/fiber** – to create 3D graphics and scenes within React (the Cube)
- **Tailwind CSS** – for utility-first styling, allowing rapid and responsive design adjustments directly in JSX.


**In Development:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MrF1ow/Portfolio)  
**Current Website:** [ethanflow.dev](https://ethanflow.dev)
