export const aboutDescription =
  "Hey, I'm Ethan, a software engineer at FAST Enterprises with a drive for building efficient and impactful systems. My journey into tech wasn’t linear (I actually started out in medicine), but once I found software engineering, I knew I’d landed where I belonged. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills across full stack development, systems programming, and AI integration, working with tools like TypeScript, C++, and Next.js. These days, I’m focused on learning new things, improving my craft, and creating solutions that make a real difference.";

export const contactDescription =
  "Whether you want to talk software, embedded systems, or just swap ideas about tech and games, I’m always up for a good conversation. Reach out through the form or any of my links below and let’s connect.";
