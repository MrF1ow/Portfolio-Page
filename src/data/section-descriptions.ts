export const aboutDescription =
  "Hey, I'm Ethan — a software engineer with a heart for building tech that matters. I didn\’t start in this field (fun fact: I was originally studying medicine), but I quickly found that solving real-world problems with code was where I belonged. I\’ve spent the past few years sharpening my skills in all kinds of development, diving into everything from TypeScript and C++ to Next.js and AI integration. I'm always exploring new tools, learning something fresh, and pushing myself to grow. Whether it\’s tackling complex challenges or creating clean, meaningful solutions, I\’m here for it.";
